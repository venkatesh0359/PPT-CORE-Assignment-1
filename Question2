Q2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development environment that provides tools necessary for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and additional development tools.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the runtime environment for executing Java applications. It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and other libraries required to run Java programs.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It provides the platform independence and manages memory, garbage collection, and other runtime functionalities.
