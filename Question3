Q3. How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?


JVM allocates memory in several areas:

Heap: It is used for dynamic memory allocation and is divided into the young generation and the old generation.

Stack: Each thread has its own stack, used to store local variables and partial results.

Method Area: It stores class-level data, such as method code, field names, and method names.

PC Registers: It holds the address of the current instruction being executed.

Native Method Stack: It contains native method information.
