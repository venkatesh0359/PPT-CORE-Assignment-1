Q7. Explain the types of variables in Java?


In Java, there are three types of variables:

Local variables: They are declared and used within a method or block and have no default values.
Instance variables: They are declared inside a class but outside any method and are unique to each instance of the class.
Class (static) variables: They are declared with the static keyword and are shared among all instances of the class.
