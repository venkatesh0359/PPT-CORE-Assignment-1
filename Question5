Q5. What are the various access specifiers in Java?


Java has four access specifiers:

Public: The member can be accessed from anywhere.
Protected: The member is accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
Default (no specifier): The member is accessible within the same package.
Private: The member is accessible only within the same class.
